# Student Automation

I made my student automation system project in Java language. I designed the interfaces with Swing in the project, where there are object-oriented programming-based operations such as encapsulation, override, inheritance, and I used the mySql Workbench database in the project. I have given the admin authority to create student and teacher objects that inherit properties from the course class and the Person class. The administrator creates objects and the information of the created objects is stored in the database. The information received from the database and the values entered by the users in the text fields on the login page are checked. The teacher can grade the students. Students can access grade information from their syllabus.

For detailed information, you can browse the report from the <h3>StudentAutomation.pdf</h3> file.
